## Welcome to Toronto Street Search

This program returns the street types for every street in Toronto using the City of Toronto's 2018 street list.
It also generates multiple choice/free response questions on the topic.

To begin, run .venv/Scripts/toronto_street_search.py. Interact with the program using the keyboard.

**Disclaimer:** This is simply coding practice for a beginner, so please expect bugs which I may have not come across.
